# Resume-project-challenge-14---OTT-platform-analysis-Lio-Jotstar
Problem Statement: 
===================
Lio, a leading telecommunications provider in India, is planning a strategic merger with Jotstar, one of the country’s most prominent streaming platforms. This potential partnership aims to combine LioCinema’s expansive subscriber base and Jotstar’s diverse content library to revolutionize digital streaming in India. As part of the merger preparation, the management team at Lio wants to analyse the performance and user behavior of both platforms—LioCinema and Jotstar—over the past one year (January to November 2024). The goal is to gain insights into individual platform performance, content consumption patterns, subscriber growth, Inactivity behavior, upgrade and downgrade trends. The insights derived from this study will help the management make informed decisions and optimize content strategies post-merger, with the ultimate goal of establishing Lio-Jotstar as the leading OTT platform in India. Peter Pandey is the data analyst at Lio, and he is tasked to analyse the data and provide insights. The management expects detailed insights into the following:
1. Content Library Analysis: A detailed comparison of content types across both platforms.
2. Subscriber Insights: Analyse trends in subscriber acquisition and demographic variations.
3. Inactivity Analysis: Patterns of inactivity across age groups, city tiers, and subscription plans.
4. Upgrade Patterns: Insights into subscription upgrades and their influencing factors.
5. Downgrade Patterns: Analysis of subscription downgrades and associated trends.
6. Content Consumption Behavior: Patterns in total watch time, device preferences, and variations by user demographics.
